Not too long ago, digital money services like debit tied to your bank account and credit cards eliminated the need to carry cash everywhere you went. Today, mobile cash apps have replaced debit and credit cards for many people. These mobile apps have barely caught on in the U.S, but services from Apple Pay to Zelle have gotten a lot of attention recently, especially from millennials. Cash App, however, is another favorite option. But what is Cash App, and can you get free money on cash?

What is Cash App?
Cash App is a simple and popular mobile payment app often used for peer-to-peer transactions. Like most mobile payment apps, Cash App‚Äôs primary functions are making payments and receiving money. However, Cash App also has some extras such as: 

Direct Deposit and early payment
Stock investing 
Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin transactions
Free tax filing via Cash App taxes for Federal and State tax services
Boost‚Äìto get instant discounts for specific services and at favorite retailers
 Like all other mobile payment apps, Cash App has to be connected to your chosen bank account to complete payment transactions or purchases. Cash App also provides Cash App users with their own physical Visa Cash App card if desired. The card is essentially a debit card that removes funds directly from your Cash App balance or connected bank account. Use it to transfer money to linked bank accounts, instantly send money to friends and other users, or trade Bitcoin. The card can also be customized with a provided doodle or a personal drawing submitted by the Cash App user. 

How Can I Hack Cash App?
A simple Google or another browser search for Cash App hack will load what seems like an endless amount of pages and websites to try. However, any alleged Cash App hack is a scam. The Cash App itself cannot be hacked. But that doesn‚Äôt mean individual accounts can‚Äôt. Hackers are clever, and they‚Äôre getting smarter daily. They‚Äôll try anything they can to steal your money, and that includes setting up cheap websites and apps claiming free Cash App money or insisting you can use it as a Cash App hack. The truth is the hacker ends up being the only one getting the Cash App free money. 

First, you‚Äôll have a set of trials and tasks to complete. Many will cost you money upfront that the hacker insists will be repaid in abundance once you get to the final page of the Cash App hack. As you progress with the tasks, you‚Äôll be required to release personal information such as your real name, email address, possible actual address, and sometimes even your social security numbers. If that doesn‚Äôt throw up the red flags, there‚Äôs more. Sometimes, you will reach the end of the Cash App hack tasks and get to the ‚Äúmoney generator.‚Äù 

This ‚Äúmoney generator‚Äù is the final part of the Cash App hack needed for the hackers to access your Cash App account. Most of the time, the generator will jam or refuse to work, so you just wasted all that time and gave a stranger your personal information for nothing. And that personal information is often sold to the dark web. If the generator does work, there‚Äôs usually a wait time before you‚Äôre allowed to ‚Äúcash out.‚Äù This allows the hacker time to access your real Cash App balance, send the ‚Äúfree Cash App money‚Äù to your contacts, and wait for them to return it to you as a refund. 

Why would they do that? Because if reported, Cash App would see that as a false or mistaken payment and replace it with actual funds. The hacker could then use those funds to buy cryptocurrency and send it to a separate, untraceable account. By the way, they‚Äôll also likely clear out your Cash App balance and could gain access to your bank account that way. So think long and hard before attempting to use a listed Cash App hack to get free money on Cash App. 

How to Get Free Money on Cash App
So then, if you can‚Äôt really hack Cash App, is there any other way to get free Cash App money or free money on the Cash App? Actually, there are several ways to get free money on Cash App.

1. Refer Your Friends and Family 
Sharing your personal referral code is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get free money online, regardless of to which website you‚Äôre referring. You can earn $10 in free money every time a contact legitimately signs up through your Cash App referral code, as long as the terms are followed. But don‚Äôt worry, there aren‚Äôt many hoops to jump through. First, make sure your friend signs up using your code. Then, send $5 to their new active Cash App account. And once Cash App confirms that they‚Äôll send your friend another $5 and they‚Äôll send you $15 for the new referral. There‚Äôs currently no limit to how many referral bonuses you can earn, so share your free money code (referral code) as often as possible to make as much free cash app money as you can.

2. Invest in Stocks or Crypto 
Cash App has an investment section. It‚Äôs an easy way to get your feet wet and potentially make a few bucks on the side. You can start with as little as a $1 investment on any stock or cryptocurrency listed or opt for recurring investment payments that fit your schedule and budget. Granted, investing isn‚Äôt the same as scoring free money, but your investments can quickly result in extra money on Cash App. Investing involves risk, so do your research before using it for Bitcoin trading or to sell cryptocurrencies. Be sure also to use the Cash App Boost instant discounts, especially those that include free Bitcoin offers. 

3. Use Cash App Taxes
Cash App offers a new free tax service to their customers called Cash App Taxes. They promise 100% free federal and state filing for members from their computer or phone, a maximum refund guarantee, and free audit defense. So this may be a no-brainer for members who don‚Äôt want to worry about filing fees for their annual or quarterly tax refunds.

4. Join Survey and Offer Sites 
There are tons of survey and offer sites to access via web browser and mobile apps, and most are completely free to join and use. Many offers also pay via Cash App. Since you can receive money anytime on Cash App, you can cash out right away or wait for a rainy day and still get free money in a snap.
